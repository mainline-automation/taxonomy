- answer: There have been 8 earth orbiting missions that have used radioisotope power, 8 missions to the outer planets, and the Apollo missions after Apollo 11 to the moon. The outer Solar System missions were Pioneer 10 and 11, Voyager 1 and 2, Ulysses, Galileo, Cassini, and New Horizons. The RTGs on Voyager 1 and 2 have been operating since 1977. Over the last four decades, 26 missions and 45 RTGs have been launched by the United States
  question: How many American missions have used radioisotope power?
- answer: Voyager only had the first two missions, to the best of my knowledge. V'ger developed from the Voyager 6 mission. It is unknown if it used radioisotope power, but it seems likely.
  question: Did V'ger use radioisotope power?
- answer: The SNAP-19 design powered Pioneer 10 and 11, as well as Viking 1 and 2 landers
  question: What missions did SNAP-19 power?
- answer: Who designed SNAP-19?
  question: SNAP-19 was developed by Teledyne Energy Systems
- answer: MMRTG is powered by eith Pu-238 dioxide general-purpose heat source (GPHS) modules provided by the US Department of energy
  question: How is MMRTG powered?
task_description: 'The multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator (MMRTG) is a type of radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) developed for NASA space missions such as the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL)'
